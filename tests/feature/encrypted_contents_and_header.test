# FIXME: Require unavailable feature to disable this test.
# We should declare this feature available when using the
# right backend. It seems that 7zip can't unrar rar files
# where the header and contents are encrypted.
# REQUIRES: not-7zip_backend

# REQUIRES: rar_binary
# Remove old temporary working directory
# RUN: rm -rf %t
# RUN: mkdir -p %t
# RUN: cd %t

# Make a simple test file and put it a rar file
# with encrypted contents and header.
# RUN: echo "Test file" > test_file
# RUN: %rar a -hptest_password test.rar test_file
# RUN: test -f test.rar
# RUN: mv test_file test_file.original

# Create password file
# RUN: echo "test_password" > password_file

# Check the test file is extracted and rar file is removed
# RUN: %unrarall --password-file ./password_file --clean=rar .
# RUN: test -f test_file
# RUN: test ! -f test.rar
# RUN: diff -q test_file test_file.original
